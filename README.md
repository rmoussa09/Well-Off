# WellOff

## Purpose:
WellOff is an android mobile application that sends out reminders to clients to get up and active throughout the day. 
The reminders are sent out based on the clients own profile page in which they would set expectations for goals regarding the amount 
of daily steps, hours of sleep and hours of screen time. Depending on their preference, they can choose at what point they
would like to recieve your reminder regarding the goals set and can customize the options to their personal meets. WellOff 
will also keep track in a calendar of your previous goals, in order to look back and reflect on the progress you've made from when
the client firt started. The application would connect to the Android's API in order to calculate how many daily steps and screen time 
they have reached and the application will automatically update according to their settings. The client can also manually input data for
their own personal reasons.

## Technology Stack:
